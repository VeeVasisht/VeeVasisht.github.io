Hello and welcome to my homepage! My name is Vee Vasisht and I am a computer science major at Cal State Fullerton University. I plan to graduate either during or before the year of 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 12
    
    The entirety of lab 12 was one of my favorites because we finally got to utilize colors in one of the labs. The challenging part of this lab was making sure that the loops that were used in the lab had the correct parameters and return values and that all of the necessary libraries were included in the code. Once that was taken care of, the gifs of both parts of the lab were just wonderful images to look at.

* Lab 08, Part 1
    
    Part 1 of lab 08 was another one of my favorites because we got to create our own tiny little mad lib. The challenging part of this lab was making sure that each variable of the mad lib was initialized with the correct element of the vector arguments. Once that was taken care of, the mad lib was spectacular as you could end up making the most random of sentences.

* Lab 06, Part 2
    
    Part 2 of lab 06 was also a favorite of mine because we got to play a game of blackjack. The challenging part of this lab was making sure that the various if statements all worked by themselves. Once that was taken care of, the blackjack game was very fun as you could end up making the most random of sentences.
